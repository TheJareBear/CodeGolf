Current Challenge: String Manipulation
===============================================================================

This challenge is created with our CSC-150 friends in mind!  Welcome friends!

Your program will read a string of arbitrary length which contains only
alpha-numeric characters (A-Z, a-z, and 0-9) followed by a newline.  It should
switch the case of all the letters (upper becomes lower, lower becomes upper),
and ignore the numbers.  It should then print the new string, followed by a
single newline.

That's it.  Simple, right?  :)


Example
===============================================================================

If your program reads the input:
abIbg8fR9g3t2F

It should output:
ABiBG8Fr9G3T2f

Or, if your program reads the input:
abcdefABCDEF1234567890

It should output:
ABCDEFabcdef1234567890
